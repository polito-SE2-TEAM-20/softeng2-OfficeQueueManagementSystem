The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
stories committed: 7
stories done: 5
- Total points committed vs. done 
Total points committed: 23 points
Total points done: 15 points
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
nr hours planned: 44h 10m
nr hours spent: 45h 10m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing: 0
- Code review completed : 5
- Code present on VCS : 5
- End-to-End tests performed : 0

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
hours estimated per task average: 2h 11m
hours actual per task average: 2h 15m
standard deviation: 1h 35m
standard deviation: 1h 13m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
Total task estimation error ratio: 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0
  - Total hours spent: 0
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 0
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0
  - Total hours spent: 0
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 0
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
     Different problems: wrong poker estimation based on the fact that we had not a complete view over the work; 
     wrong estimation on our skills since we did not know each other.
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
     We have to create smaller tasks and better splitting time between development, testing and code review.
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  --
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  --
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
     From a technical point of view: learn how to  write tests, vcs and code review. 
     In terms of team coordination better planning according previous flaws.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
     We are proud of how we prepared demo and of helping each other, responsibly, to achieve our goals.
